Europe has, for centuries, been a powerhouse of production and technical innovation at the forefront of global technological advancement, setting an example for the world.

Businesses in Europe have generated unprecedented wealth in the past, but to maintain a position of leadership in the global economy, we believe that old ways of thinking and acting have to change and new approaches have to be adopted.

    communityDescription: `
We believe that, despite the new challenges posed, established corporations have profound advantages and the rapidly unfolding Fourth Industrial Revolution is an opportunity to solve many of the biggest issues of our time, such as climate change.

The Fightback Movement is about collaboration; not just between tech entrepreneurs, business leaders, and policy-makers, but across industries and nations, with the aim of building a pan-European ecosystem, where knowledge, growth capital, and technical capabilities can be shared and harnessed. When coupled with an entrepreneurial mindset, incumbent businesses will then be in a strong position to build sustainable businesses fit for the future.

But, no technological change can take place without a shift in mindset. A cultural change is essential, beginning with business leaders in incumbent organisations. Only then can large corporates utilise their strong assets and digitalise their business with new innovative business models. We all share a responsibility, and change must happen, today, to ensure prosperity for future generations.`,
